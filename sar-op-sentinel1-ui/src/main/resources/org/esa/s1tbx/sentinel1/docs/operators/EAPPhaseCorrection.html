<h3><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">Elevation Antenna Pattern Phase Correction</span></span></h3>
<p>The Elevation Antenna Patterns (EAPs) used by the
S-1 Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) are derived from the S-1
Antenna Model (AM) which is able to predict with great accuracy the
gain and phase patterns.<br>
<br>
The EAP correction by the S-1 IPF was at launch only considering the
gain of the EAP. Similarly to what was done for ASAR. As an outcome of
the S-1A Commissioning Phase, it has been decided to upgrade the S-1
IPF to also correct for the EAP phase, in order to correct for the
induced phase difference between the polarimetric channels.<br>
<br>
This correction has been introduced in March 2015 with the IPF V243.
Performing interferograms between products generated with the IPFV243
and the former version V236 leads to phase offset.<br>
<br>
This operator performs EAP corrections for products generated before
March 2015 [1]. <span style="font-family: &quot;Times&quot;,New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"></span></p>
